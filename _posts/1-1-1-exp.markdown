* Conduct interdisciplinary research in computer science and neuroscience


* Investigate different methodologies of different neurons using machine learning technique to analyze 3D images of neurons


* Tackle the long-known NP-complete graph matching problem with a graduated assignment algorithm 


* Implement a probabilistic parametric model to automatically generalize spatial pattern similarity from sample attributed relational graphs(ARGs) and detect similar spatial pattern on new ARGs.
