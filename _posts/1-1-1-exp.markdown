* Conduct interdisciplinary research in computer science, biology and linguistic using statistic machine learning and deep learning approach with Professor Pengyu Hong at Brandeis University

* Tackle the NP-complete graph matching problem with a graduated assignment algorithm and implement a probabilistic parametric model to automatically generalize similar patterns from a set of sample attributed relational graphs(ARGs) and detect similar spatial pattern from new graph

* Apply the model above in biology domain and innovate a new way to match proteins in their tertiary(three dimension) structure instead of their primary(linear) structure

* Implement computational linguistic models using word vector, neural network and other statistical tools to match sentences in the same conversational context

* Technology involves MATLAB Machine Learning Toolbox, Parallel Computing Toolbox and MATLAB OOP scheme, which can be further developed and used by other MATLAB community members
