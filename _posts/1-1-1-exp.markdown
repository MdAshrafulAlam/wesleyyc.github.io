* Conduct interdisciplinary research in computer science and biology by using machine learning technique

* Tackle the NP-complete graph matching problem with a graduated assignment algorithm

* Implement a probabilistic parametric model to automatically generalize similar patterns from a set of sample attributed relational graphs(ARGs) and detect similar spatial pattern from new graph

* Innovate a new way to match proteins with 3D structure instead of the traditional sequence matching using the above pattern generalization algorithm 

* Implement the algorithm using MATLAB Machine Learning Toolbox and MATLAB OOP scheme, which can be further developed and used by other MATLAB community members
