title: Automatic Spatial Pattern Extraction with Application to Mining Protein Structures and Neuron Morphologies
description: |
---
* Apply a pattern recognition machine learning model and innovate a new way to match proteins in their tertiary(three dimension) structure instead of their primary(linear) structure

* Preprocess biology data, specifically protein crystal structure data from protein data bank

* Tune and customized a pattern extraction machine learning model with high throughput protein data using parallel computing tools and robust EM algorithm to handle a high level of protein sequence noise

* Optimize the implementation using MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox and visualize matching in 3D using biograph
