title: Protein Domain Structure <br> Generalization Model
description: |
---
* Apply a pattern recognition machine learning model and innovate a new way to match proteins in their tertiary structure(three dimension) instead of their primary(linear) structure

* Preprocess biology data, specifically protein crystal structure data from protein data bank

* Tune and customized a general machine learning model with high throughput protein data using parallel computing tools

* Implement the algorithm using MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox
